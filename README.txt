Each of the folder contains MATLAB functions and scripts for making the numerical simulations in the thesis. 

1) The folder "B_Lump-sum Cobb-Douglas" and folder "B_Subsidy_Cobb-Douglas" contain a the codes for contructing indifference curves of Pareto-improving test for Cobb-Douglas Case. For example, these folder is used for constructing Figure 5 to Figure 8 in the thesis. To start the simulation for a Capital Income Subsidy Scheme: enter folder "B_Subsidy_Cobb-Douglas" -> open file "startlog" -> adjust the parameters ->run the scripts. For Lump-sum Transfer Scheme, This can be done in Folder "B_Lump-sum Cobb-Douglas" and run the script "LumStartLog".

2) The folder "A_Lump-sum CES" and folder "B_Subsidy_CES" contain the code for varying the intertemporal and factor substitutability case. For lump-sum scheme, start the numerical simulation by running the script "LumStartCES". For the capital subsidy scheme, the script is "StartCESFixed". Change the parameters if needed. For example, "StartCESFixed" and "LumStartCES" are used for constructing Figure 14 and Figure 17 in the thesis.

3) For constructing other figures (also adjust the parameters to reproduce similar results as in the thesis). 
- Figure 9(a) : Enter folder "D_Pollution Rate Plotting" -> run the script "Pollution_mt_plot". 
- Figure 9(b) : Enter folder "D_Interest Rate Plotting" -> run the file "interestrate_mt_plot". 
- Figure 15(a): Open folder "A_Subsidy_CES"-> run script "Theta_k1_plot_tau". - Figure 15(b) and Figure 16: Open folder "D_Subsidy_theta_mt" -> run script "plot_theta_mt_taufixed.m". 
- Figure 18 and Figure 25 : Open folder "C_Comparative Statics" -> run "Plot_theta_k_difftransferboth.m".
